# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

Welcome to the Tic-Tac-Toe game! This is a simple implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game written in Java. The game allows two players to play against each other on a 3x3 board.

## Features

Two-player game

Players take turns to place their marks (X or O) on the board

The game checks for a win condition after each move

The game announces the winner once a player has won

Prevents invalid moves

## Game Loop

The game loop continues until a player wins. Each turn, the current state of the board is printed, and the current player is prompted to enter their move. The game then checks if the move is valid and if the player has won. If a player wins, the game announces the winner and ends.
